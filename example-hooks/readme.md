# Examples

These are some example hooks you can put into the ansible playbook in order to kustomize your Kubernetes cluster.

These hooks are not expected to maintain or upgrade versions of the software installed. They are only for bootstrapping.

These are working examples and should help serve as a baseline to bootstrap a cluster that would further be managed.

We recommend using a GitOps tool like ArgoCD or Flux to manage the clusters.
